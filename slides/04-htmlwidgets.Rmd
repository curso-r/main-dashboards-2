## Eventos no leaflet

Leaflet maps and objects send input values (which we’ll refer to as “events” in this document) to Shiny as the user interacts with them.

Object events
Object event names generally use this pattern:

input$MAPID_OBJCATEGORY_EVENTNAME

So for a leafletOutput("mymap") had a circle on it, clicking on that circle would update the Shiny input at input$mymap_shape_click. (Note that the layer ID is not part of the name, though it is part of the value.)

If no shape has ever been clicked on this map, then input$mymap_shape_click is null.

Valid values for OBJCATEGORY above are marker, shape, geojson, and topojson. (Tiles and controls don’t raise mouse events.) Valid values for EVENTNAME are click, mouseover, and mouseout.

All of these events are set to either NULL if the event has never happened, or a list() that includes:

lat - The latitude of the object, if available; otherwise, the mouse cursor
lng - The longitude of the object, if available; otherwise, the mouse cursor
id - The layerId, if any
GeoJSON events also include additional properties:

featureId - The feature ID, if any
properties - The feature properties
Map events
The map itself also has a few input values/events.

input$MAPID_click is an event that is sent when the map background or basemap is clicked. The value is a list with lat and lng.

input$MAPID_bounds provides the latitude/longitude bounds of the currently visible map area; the value is a list() that has named elements north, east, south, and west.

input$MAPID_zoom is an integer that indicates the zoom level.

input$MAPID_center provides the latitude/longtitude of the center of the currently visible map area; the value is a list() that has named elements lat and lng.
